The models for the paper:

Wang XJ (1994) Multiple dynamical modes of thalamic relay neurons:
rhythmic bursting and intermittent phase-locking.
Neuroscience 59(1):21-31

were recreated in the paper:

Detorakis G (2016) [Re] Multiple dynamical modes of thalamic relay
neurons: rhythmic bursting and intermittent phase-locking.
ReScience 2(1):1-11

and are available in Python 3 code at this github link:

Here are some images generated from the Detorakis 2016 code that are
similar to figures in the Wang 1994 paper:
